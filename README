rpn_calc_on_clojure
===================

The code in this repository represents my total sum of Clojure learning to date.

The end result should be a RPN calculator service accessible through the network.

Setup
=====

1. Get Java & Clojure

2. Run the rpn.clj script through Clojure:
   $ java -classpath $CLOJURE_JAR:$CLOJURE_CONTRIB_JAR clojure.lang.Script rpn.clj

3. From another terminal, use netcat to send data:
   $ echo "(+ 1 2 3) (- 4 5 6) 'quit" | nc 127.0.0.1 5001

4. Read the results on-screen:
   6
   -7
   Connection closed by client, closing socket
